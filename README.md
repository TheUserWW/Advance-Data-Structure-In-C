# Ultra-Extension-For-C-language
The standard C language doesn't provide enough data structure and algorithm templates.<br> So, I add some useful  templates in C language, which makes you programming more efficient and pleasant.<br>
To get more details, please read the document.

All of thing are based on std C, so you don't need extra library to support those thing.
## Available data structure templates:
**HashMap** <br>
**HashSet** <br>
**Stack**  <br>
**Queue**  <br>
**Priority** **Queue** <br>

## Available algorithm lib: <br>
**find.h**

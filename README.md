# Ultra-Extension-For-C-language
The standard C language doesn't provide enough data structure and algorithm templates. So, I add some useful  templates in C language, which makes you programming more efficient and pleasant.

All of thing are based on std C, so you don't need extra library to support those thing.
## Available data structure templates:
**HashMap**
**HashSet**
**Stack**
**Queue**
**Priority** **Queue** 

## Available algorithm lib: 
**find.h**
